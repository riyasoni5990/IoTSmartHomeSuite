# IOT-Based Home Automation System
This README.md file explains the code for an IoT-based Home Automation system written for an ESP8266 microcontroller using the Arduino framework. The system is designed to automate home devices and can be controlled remotely through a Blynk mobile app. Additionally, it provides OTA (Over-the-Air) firmware updates for the microcontroller.

## Introduction
This code controls home devices using an ESP8266 microcontroller. It connects to the Blynk cloud service for remote control and synchronization. Additionally, the system uses NTP (Network Time Protocol) to maintain accurate time and provides Over-the-Air firmware updates.

## Requirements
Before you can use this code, you'll need the following components and services:
- ESP8266 microcontroller.
- Arduino IDE for programming.
- A Wi-Fi network for the ESP8266 to connect to.
- Blynk mobile app for remote control.
- An NTP server for time synchronization.
- Access to an OTA service.

## Setup and Configuration
#### Hardware Setup
1. Connect your ESP8266 to the home automation devices (e.g., relays) that you want to control.
2. Ensure the ESP8266 is connected to your Wi-Fi network.

#### Software Setup
1. Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE.
- ESP8266WiFi
- ESP8266mDNS
- WiFiUdp
- NTPClient
- ArduinoOTA
- BlynkSimpleEsp8266
- ESP8266HTTPClient
2. Set up Blynk by obtaining an authentication token and updating the auth variable in the code.
3. Configure the Wi-Fi network by updating the ssid and password variables.
4. Customize the OTA settings by modifying ArduinoOTA.setHostname and ArduinoOTA.setPassword.
5. Set up your device's network configuration by modifying the IP addresses and MAC address in the code.
6. Customize the time zone by modifying the utcOffsetInSeconds and NTP server in the NTPClient initialization.

#### Code Explanation
Here is an overview of the code and its functionality:

1. The code establishes a connection to the Wi-Fi network and configures the ESP8266 to connect to it.
2. It sets up Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates for the ESP8266, allowing you to update the firmware remotely.
3. The Blynk library is used to connect the ESP8266 to the Blynk cloud service for remote control.
4. The turnoffall function sends HTTP requests to turn off devices. It is called at startup to ensure all devices are off.
5. The Blynk_Delay function is used to periodically run the Blynk service and maintain communication with the Blynk app.
6. In the loop function, the code checks the time, and if it's outside a specified time range (e.g., nighttime), it turns off all devices.
7. The timeClient object is used to get the current time from an NTP server.
8. The ArduinoOTA library handles OTA updates and associated error handling.

#### Usage
1. Upload this code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
2. Ensure the ESP8266 is connected to your home automation devices.
3. Open the Blynk mobile app and use the authentication token to control your devices remotely.
4. The ESP8266 will automatically update its firmware if you upload a new version using OTA.

Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your specific home automation needs. Enjoy your IoT-based home automation system!
